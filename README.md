You can view the following API routes:

1. Get all posts: `GET` /api/posts

You need to create these:

1. Create a post: `POST` /api/posts
2. Get a single post: `GET` /api/posts/{postId}
3. Update a post: `PUT/PATCH` /api/posts/{postId}
4. Delete a post: `DELETE` /api/posts/{postId}


## Forking the Sample App Source Code

To make a copy, click the Fork button above and follow the on-screen instructions. In this case, you'll be forking this repo as a starting point for your own app (see [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to learn more about forking repos.

After forking the repo, you should now be viewing this README in your own github org (e.g. `https://github.com/<your-org>/laravel-test`)
